                I am a student in Management Information Systems at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. I grew up in
            Omaha Nebraska and was adopted at the age of nine months old to the best parents I could have ever 
            asked for. I currently work serving/bar tending jobs to support myself until I can get an internship.
            Growing up I enjoyed sports such as baseball, bowling, and basketball, but the thing I enjoyed the 
            most was riding motorcycles.

                I've owned a handful of bikes in my life starting with dirt bikes and
            working my way up to street bikes. My first bike was a 125CC Chinese off brand dirt bike that didn't
            have a clutch and was so much fun as it shifted automatically when I would kick the gear shifter. 
            The next dirt bike I had was passed down to me from my dad and it was a 250CC Chinese off brand bike
            with a clutch that would always tend to die at the worst times. When I turned 20, I purchased a 
            2013 Kawasaki Ninja 300 ABS and it was such a clean sport bike, otherwise known at a crotch rocket, 
            that was a nice bike to learn on. The only thing that I didn't care for about it was how many times 
            I had to shift gears just to get up to a reasonable speed so I was ready to upgrade within about
            a month but had planned to keep it for a while. The downfall was I only got to keep it for a few 
            months due to a guy running a red light and totaling my bike with me on it. I ended up shattering 
            my wrist in the process plus a couple of ribs. After the long process of going through insurance 
            and having to get a lawyer involved to ensure that I wasn't done dirty by the insurance companies, 
            I was able to get another motorcycle which was my dream bike.

                The motorcycle I got next was a 2004 Honda CBR1000RR, and what a beautiful bike it was. It had it's
                issues over the few years I had it where the stator and rectifier
            were giving me problems but I was able to diagnose what was wrong on my own and fix them so I saved myself
            a lot of money and learning quite a bit. The downfall is that halfway through this riding season is that
            one of my rod bearings became spun so technically my engine is on its way to being blown so I haven't
            been able to ride anymore trying to preserve the engine as much as possible. The fix is out of my 
            budget so now the bike it currently on the market and will hopefully have a person buying it this weekend.
