                Here is a picture of my beautiful 2004 Honda CBR1000RR, that is while it's still mine.
                It'll be a shame when I have to sell it, but I don't have the money right now to fix it
                since it would be a cheap fix. Also I will get more use out of the money for the time being
                until I can afford another bike which will either be a cruiser or I may go back to owning
                a dirt bike. If I were to get a dirt bike, I would get one that is street legal so I could
                enjoy it on the streets and off road. There is nothing like riding a motorcycle through the
                woods in a secluded area or alongside the river.

                This is what my 2013 Kawasaki Ninja 300 ABS looked like after my accident. I was riding
                north down Cuming St on my way to work it had just sprinkled earlier in the day. I was coming
                upon Martha St where there were building blocking my view of oncoming traffic to the east.
                The light turned green as I was approaching the intersection and a person ran the red light
                trying to make a last minute turn far too late from the light changing. After he had pulled out
                into the intersection, instead of following through with his poor decision which he
                would have been fine if he did, he decided to stop in the middle of the road. I immediately
                reacted by slamming on my breaks which didnt work due to the ground being slightly wet
                and I slid into him causing me to flip off my bike head first into his car. The funny thing is
                that as I was laying there on the ground waiting for the ambulance, my dad had accidentally
                driven passed me without even knowing it was me on the ground because he wasn't able to get
                a good look at me or the bike that was involved in the crash.
