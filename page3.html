                When I was a baby, my birth dad was not around, and my birth mom was not capable of taking care of me
                due to drug problems. I was put into a foster home where I was not taken care of and was left in a
                carseat for about nine months straight. Due to not being interacted with or picked up for that long,
                I ended up becoming very disconnected with my surroundings and the back of my head became flat. The day
                I got adopted by my parents, the cops were going to take me out of the house due to child neglection
                along with my birth sister who was, unfortunately, more long-term affected by the house. My mom came to
                pick me up in the tremendous snowstorm of 1996 so the cops wouldn't need to. When my parents got me, the
                doctors said that there was no guarantee that I would catch up and snap back into the stage where I
                should've been at my age and that my head was passed the point where I could get a helmet to reshape my
                head to how it should be. Luckily I didn't need one and my head naturally went back to normal. My
                parents said when they first got me all I did was look around at my surroundings as if I was just
                continuously observing everything but also seemed to look through it all. But later they realized that
                also as a baby I had attention for detail even though I wasn't being taught anything. After no time at
                all, I caught back up to the level I was suppose to be at from just my parents playing with me. Due to
                my constant observations, I went from scooting straight to walking and skipped the crawling or learning
                to stand phase. As I got older, I was placed into high ability learner classes. I have my parents to
                thank for turning my life around from the direction it was originally heading in.
